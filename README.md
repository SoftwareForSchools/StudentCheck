# StudentCheck #
This project is for scanning if students are present in courses. The project consist of two applications, a Java Application and a Android Application.

Instead of a Readme, we made use of the Wiki on github.
Thus far we have made the following contents on the Wiki:

**Wiki**
* How to install
* Interfaces explained
* Class structure
* Sequence diagrams

All of which can be found on:
